   node --version
   npm --version
   
   # If not, download from:
   # https://nodejs.org/ (choose LTS version)
   ```

2. **Set up your workspace**

   ```

3. **Install VS Code extensions** (recommended)
   - Node.js Extension Pack
   - ESLint
   - Prettier
   - REST Client

### Learning Path

#### Week 1: Fundamentals (20-30 hours)
Start here: [`week-01-fundamentals/day-01-introduction`](./week-01-fundamentals/day-01-introduction/theory.md)

**Daily routine:**
1. Read theory (30-45 min)
2. Watch related videos (optional, 20-30 min)
3. Complete exercises (60-90 min)
4. Build practice project (30-60 min)
5. Review and take notes (15 min)

#### Week 2-8: Progressive Learning
Follow the roadmap sequentially for best results.

### Study Tips

#### 🎯 Effective Learning
- **Code along**: Don't just read, type every example
- **Break down**: Take breaks every 90 minutes
- **Build projects**: Apply concepts immediately
- **Debug actively**: Embrace errors as learning opportunities
- **Relate to frontend**: Connect backend concepts to your frontend knowledge

#### 📝 Note Taking
- Keep a learning journal
- Document "aha moments"
- Create your own examples
- Build a personal cheatsheet

#### 🤝 Get Help
- Read error messages carefully
- Search Google/Stack Overflow
- Use Node.js official documentation
- Join Node.js Discord/Reddit communities
- Ask specific questions with code examples

### Project Structure

Each day includes:
```
day-XX-topic/
├── theory.md          # Core concepts & explanations
├── exercises/         # Practice problems
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solutions/    # Try yourself first!
└── practice/         # Real-world mini project
    └── README.md
```

### Suggested Schedule

#### Option 1: Full-time Learning (8 weeks)
- 4-5 hours/day
- 5 days/week
- Complete 1 week of content per week

#### Option 2: Part-time Learning (12-16 weeks)
- 2-3 hours/day
- 5-6 days/week
- Complete 1 week of content every 2 weeks

#### Option 3: Casual Learning (4-6 months)
- 1-2 hours/day
- 3-5 days/week
- Learn at your own pace

### Tracking Progress

1. **Update PROGRESS.md** daily
   - Mark completed lessons
   - Note challenges and victories
   - Track time spent

2. **Complete all exercises**
   - Don't skip hands-on practice
   - Try solving before checking solutions
   - Experiment with variations

3. **Build projects**
   - Each day has a practice project
   - Add personal touches
   - Push to GitHub

### Getting Unstuck

**Debugging checklist:**
- [ ] Read the error message completely
- [ ] Check syntax (typos, missing brackets)
- [ ] Console.log intermediate values
- [ ] Verify file paths and module names
- [ ] Check Node.js version compatibility
- [ ] Search for the exact error message

**Still stuck?**
- Take a break and come back fresh
- Explain the problem out loud (rubber duck debugging)
- Create a minimal reproducible example
- Ask for help with specific details
